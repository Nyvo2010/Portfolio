            <p>Atlas is an autonomous AI agent built as a self-initiated project to explore modern AI agent architectures and the emerging “agent hype” of 2025. It runs entirely in the terminal and is powered by Mistral AI, using MCP (Model Context Protocol) for structured tool interaction.</p>
            <p>The agent is capable of using its own browser, interacting with the DOM, and accessing external tools such as a calendar, email, and system commands. Rather than being a simple chatbot, Atlas can observe, plan, and act across multiple steps, making it closer to a real software agent than a prompt-based assistant.</p>
            <p>This project was primarily a learning exercise, aimed at understanding how autonomous agents reason, use tools, and maintain context over time. Building Atlas gave me hands-on experience with agent design, tool orchestration, and the limitations of current AI systems, while staying grounded in realistic capabilities rather than demos or hype.</p>`,

            <p>Sizzle is a cooking-focused web application designed to make the cooking experience more efficient and enjoyable. Built as a school project, it emphasizes a clean, minimal interface while still offering powerful features such as user profiles and AI-assisted functionality.</p>
            <p>The application is structured around the idea that good design reduces friction. Small details—such as streamlined navigation, clear recipe steps, and personalized user experiences—were deliberately added to improve usability. User accounts allow preferences and progress to be stored, making the app feel personal rather than generic.</p>
            <p>AI features in Sizzle are used to enhance, not replace, the cooking process. Instead of over-automating, the AI supports users by helping with decisions, organization, or inspiration. This project demonstrates my interest in combining frontend design, backend logic, and AI in a practical, user-centered way.</p>`,

            <p>Glidr is a custom-built web browser developed in Python using PyQt5, created as part of a school computer science project. It combines a traditional browsing experience with an embedded AI chat assistant directly inside the interface.</p>
            <p>The project focuses on understanding how browsers work at a fundamental level, including rendering web content, handling user input, and managing application state. By building Glidr from scratch instead of relying on an existing browser framework, I gained hands-on experience with GUI design, event-driven programming, and application architecture in Python.</p>
            <p>A key feature of Glidr is its integrated AI assistant, which allows users to interact with an AI while browsing. This explores how AI can be embedded into everyday software tools to improve usability and workflow, rather than existing as a separate application. The project balances technical implementation with usability, keeping the interface minimal and intuitive.</p>`,

            <p>Hi 👋, i'm Niek (Nyvo). I'm a computer science student who got into programming out of curiosity. I like taking things apart, figuring out how they work, and then trying to build them back better. What started as small experiments grew into building full projects where both the technical side and the user experience matter.</p>
            <p>I care a lot about details. Not just whether something works, but how it behaves in edge cases, how it feels to use, and whether the decisions behind it actually make sense. I tend to question my own assumptions and refine things until they hold up.</p>
            <p>Outside of programming, I'm also involved in music production, which influences how I think about software: structured, but still creative and human. A quote that really fits how I work is Socrates’ “The unexamined life is not worth living.” I try to apply that mindset to everything I build.</p>`,
